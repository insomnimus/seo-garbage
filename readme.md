# seo-garbage

This repository contains a list of sites that I've come across in various search results that are clearly AI generated, nothing but SEO garbage or are simply scraping other sites to generate pages.

It is updated as long as I browse the internet.

Note that most sites here offer little to no value to anyone (and I only say "most" because I obviously don't have time to check every page of a given site).
If a page seems fishy, my process to determine whether to block or not is by visiting the homepage:
- Many automated content farms have the same or similar cookie cutter template.
- A third of them also have posts that are all over the place in terms of topics; for example a cooking site might have an article on buying PC gear.
- A surprising amount of content farms don't even have a homepage! In which case the page does not load at all.

In the end we're not running out of sites on the internet. Valuable sites are easy to spot; those won't be added to this list. None of your favourite sites are, or will ever be, blocked here.
